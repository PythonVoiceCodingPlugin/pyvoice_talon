# Interacting with sublime

Executing commands for sublime text is preformed via its commandline interface `subl` which may NOT always be in system path on all platforms. By  the talon client will search through specific directories based on your operating system in order to find its location. If this procedure fails, error should appear in the logs. In that case please see the official sublime documentation
